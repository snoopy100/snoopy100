<p>
Snoopy first appeared in the October 4, 1950 2 days after the strip began. Charles Shulz originally planned to call Snoopy "Sniffle" but that name was taken by another strip.<br>
He also planned to call the strip "lil' folks" but it sounded to similar to another strip. So he chose the name "Peanuts". The name first appeared in November 10, 1950. He <br>
got the name "Snoopy" from the dog he had as a teenager his name was "Spike", and he loosely based Snoopy off him. After that the Penauts strip then took off.
